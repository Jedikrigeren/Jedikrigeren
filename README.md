- Hi, Iâ€™m @Jedikrigeren
- I'm a developer who specializes in Integrations, which I build using GOLANG / Typescript (Deno). I also have experience building websites with React.
- I love solving problems and working with Data as well. I have been coding for a few years now, both in my free time and at work, and recently I have been learning how AI can help me work more efficiently and even write better code.
