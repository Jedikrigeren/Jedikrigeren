- Hi, Iâ€™m @Jedikrigeren
- I'm mostly interested in backend development and data science, but I'm currently learning ReactJS so I'll have a better understanding of the complete product and how the      whole process is.
- Once I feel comfortable creating websites as a full stack developer, I aim to dive back into learning python and getting more proffecient with data science.
- In my dayjob I handle a lot of data, mostly using SQL and other tools within SAP Business One, which is where my interest in data science has originated from, although I've always had a fascination with Machine Learning.
- Apart from data science, I also have an interest in investing in stocks.
